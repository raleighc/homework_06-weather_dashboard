##What am I accomplishing?

I am creating a website that pulls weather information from API to populate my page.

##What I need TODO:

    -draw a diagram of page layout in the grid
        -note which elements need to be hardcoded in the HTML and which elements need to be dynamically populated with JavaScript.
        -what are the individual elements inside my grid?
            -What function do those elements serve and what tools can I use to accomplish those functions.
    
    -pseudo code my next steps from a 10k view.
        -once I get that down move to the first step and pseudo code each stuff before coding that element.
        -work on committing more often this project.  Never go beyond one major step before each commit.
